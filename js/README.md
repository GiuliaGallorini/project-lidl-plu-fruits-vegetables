# PLU Fruits&Vegs

[Link to the game](https://giuliagallorini.github.io/project-plu-fruits-vegetables/)

## The idea: a practical problem in the supermarket 
This is my first project at the Web Development bootcamp at Ironhack.
It was inspired by my previous job experience as area manager for supermarkets, and it is aimed to solve a practical problem: when a new shop assistant is hired, the training includes learning by heart up to two hundreds codes, mostly for fruits and vegetables that are daily fresh products. It is not mandatory, but if everybody is well trained there are a lot of benefits: a shorter time in the queue for the customers waiting at the cash register, more precise information about the quantities sold and that have to be reordered, the reduction of wasted products and consequently better inventory results. 

## My project: a memory game for learning PLU codes of fruits and vegetables
I built a basic memory game where the player has to type the right PLU code ("Price look-up" code) before the item disappears from the display, with three different levels of difficulty and three different speed.
For every code right guessed, he gains two points.
For every item missed, he loses one point.
The game is over with -10 points.
With 20 points, he wins the game and display how many times he asked for help.
The game is mobile-responsive.

## Instructions
Each variety of fruit and vegetable corresponds to a PLU code.
Press the "spacebar" or "i" to learn the corresponding PLU.
While displaying the PLU, you can not type your code: press the "spacebar" or "i" again.
Type the right PLU code and press "Enter" to submit, or "back" to delete.
Increase the level to test your knowledge!
Have fun!

## Possible improvements

2. Add "bonus" fruits and vegetables with special features;
3. Add useful nutritional info about the products;
4. Add a third category of products: daily baked bread;
5. Add notifications on mobile when new products are arriving, to help the shop assistants to memorize the code, ex. for seasonal products;
